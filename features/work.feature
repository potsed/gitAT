Feature: Work Branch Creation (Conventional Commits)
  As a developer using GitAT
  I want to create work branches following Conventional Commits specification
  So that I can maintain organized development workflow with proper commit types

  Background:
    Given I am in a git repository
    And I have a trunk branch configured
    And I am on a feature branch

  Scenario: Create feature branch with description
    When I run "git @ work feature add-user-auth"
    Then it should create a feature branch named "feature-add-user-auth"

    And it should set the working branch to the feature branch

  Scenario: Create hotfix branch with description
    When I run "git @ work hotfix fix-login-bug"

    And it should show "Setting working branch to feature branch..."

  Scenario: Success message with status information
    When I run "git @ work feature add-auth"
    Then it should show "âœ… feature branch 'feature-add-auth' created successfully!"

    Given I am on a hotfix branch
    When I run "git @ save 'Fix critical security bug'"
    Then the commit message should start with "[HOTFIX]"
