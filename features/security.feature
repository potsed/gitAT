Feature: GitAT Security Hardening
  As a security-conscious developer
  I want the GitAT plugin to be protected against common vulnerabilities
  So that it can be safely used in production environments

  Background:
    Given the GitAT plugin is installed
    And the user has appropriate permissions
    And the repository is properly initialized

  Scenario: Command Injection Protection
    Given a malicious user provides input with shell commands
    When the input is processed by GitAT commands
    Then the shell commands should not be executed
    And the input should be properly sanitized
    And an error message should be displayed

  Scenario: Path Traversal Protection
    Given a user provides a path with "../" sequences
    When the path is used in file operations
    Then the path should be validated
    And access should be restricted to the repository root
    And an error should be thrown for invalid paths

  Scenario: Input Validation
    Given a user provides various types of input
    When the input is processed by GitAT
    Then all input should be validated
    And invalid input should be rejected
    And appropriate error messages should be shown

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation Protection
    Given the GitAT plugin is running
    When operations are performed
    Then no operations should require elevated privileges
    And user permissions should be verified
    And operations should be restricted to the repository scope

  Scenario: Data Exposure Protection
    Given sensitive data is stored in Git config
    When the data is accessed or displayed
    Then sensitive information should not be exposed
    And proper access controls should be enforced
    And audit logs should be maintained

  Scenario: Error Handling
    Given an error occurs during GitAT operations
    When the error is handled
    Then the error should be logged
    And sensitive information should not be exposed in error messages
    And the system should fail securely

  Scenario: Safe Command Execution
    Given GitAT needs to execute commands
    When commands are executed
    Then only safe commands should be allowed
    And command arguments should be properly escaped
    And execution should be logged

  Scenario: Authentication and Authorization
    Given a user attempts to perform operations
    When permissions are checked
    Then user identity should be verified
    And appropriate permissions should be required
    And unauthorized access should be denied

  Scenario: Logging and Monitoring
    Given critical operations are performed
    When operations are logged
    Then all critical operations should be logged
    And logs should include relevant context
    And logs should be protected from tampering

  Scenario: Configuration Security
    Given GitAT configuration is stored
    When configuration is accessed
    Then configuration files should have appropriate permissions
    And sensitive configuration should be encrypted
    And configuration should be validated

  Scenario: Secure Defaults
    Given GitAT is installed with default settings
    When the plugin is used
    Then secure defaults should be applied
    And insecure options should be disabled by default
    And users should be warned about security implications

  Scenario: Dependency Security
    Given GitAT depends on external tools
    When dependencies are used
    Then dependencies should be validated
    And known vulnerabilities should be checked
    And secure versions should be required

  Scenario: Update Security
    Given GitAT updates are available
    When updates are applied
    Then updates should be verified
    And integrity checks should be performed
    And rollback capabilities should be available
