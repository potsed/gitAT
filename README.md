## Quick Start

1. **Initialize in a Git repository:**

   ```bash
   git @ product "MyProject"
   git @ _trunk master
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git @ work feature add-user-authentication
   ```

3. **Make changes and save:**

   ```bash
   git @ save "Add user authentication system"
   ```

4. **Create a pull request:**

   git @ pr
   ```

## Configuration

GitAT uses Git configuration to store project settings:

- `at.product` - Product name
- `at.feature` - Current feature name
- `at.task` - Current task/issue ID
- `at.branch` - Working branch
- `at.trunk` - Trunk branch (master/main)
- `at.version` - Current version
- `at.wip` - Work in progress branch

## Conventional Commits

GitAT follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New features (MINOR version)
- `fix:` - Bug fixes (PATCH version)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests

## Examples

### Creating Different Work Types

```bash
git @ work feature add-payment-gateway
git @ work bugfix fix-login-validation
git @ work docs update-api-documentation
git @ work refactor optimize-database-queries
```

### Managing Branches

```bash
git @ branch -c                    # Show current branch
git @ branch --feature             # List feature branches
git @ branch --all-types           # List all branch types
```

### Creating Pull Requests

```bash
git @ pr                           # Create PR with auto-description
git @ pr -s                        # Create PR with auto-squashing
git @ pr --title "Custom Title"    # Create PR with custom title
```

### Cleaning Up Branches

```bash
git @ sweep                        # Clean merged + remote-deleted branches
git @ sweep --local-only           # Clean only locally merged branches
git @ sweep --force                # Force clean (including squash-merged)
git @ sweep --dry-run              # Preview what would be deleted
```
