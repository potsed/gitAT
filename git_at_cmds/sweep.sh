Usage: git @ sweep

DESCRIPTION:
  Clean up local branches that have been merged into trunk.
  Deletes local copies of branches that are no longer needed.

PROCESS:
  1. Identifies branches merged into trunk
  2. Deletes local copies of merged branches
  3. Preserves important branches (trunk, master, main, dev, develop, staging, stage, qa)

EXAMPLES:
  git @ sweep                    # Clean up merged branches

SAFETY:
  - Only deletes branches that are fully merged
  - Preserves important branches (trunk, master, main, dev, develop, staging, stage, qa)
  - Does not affect remote branches

SECURITY:
  All sweep operations are validated and logged.
